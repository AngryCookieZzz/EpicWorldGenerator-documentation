# Commands
In order to use EWG to its full potential, there are a few handy commands for you to use.

`/ewg createworld`
> This command opens a GUI from which you can pick a preset for a new world.

`/ewg info`
> This command shows you what biome you are currently in, so you can find it in the configuration files easier.

`/ewg tp`
> This command lets you teleport to a biome of your choice. The biome name is the same as the one you get from `/ewg info`, and the same as the name of the file in the configurations.

`/ewg create`
> This command allows to turn your WorldEdit selection into a EWG schematic (not the same as normal WorldEdit schematics). You first select the structure with WorldEdit, then use the command, specifying the center X, Y and Z positions, as well as a name.
> The X, Y and Z positions will correspond to the location at which the plugin will paste the schematic in the world.

`/ewg paste`
> This command pastes any EWG structure you provide. You can find the name of the structure in the structures folder. `*/plugins/EpicWorldGenerator/EWGFiles/`.

`/ewg bugreport`
> This command is outdated and should no longer be used, instead, use the [this](https://github.com/jonryf/EpicWorldGenerator-bugtracker/issues).

`/ewg install`
> TODO
