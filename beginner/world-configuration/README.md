# World configuration

EpicWorldGenerator is a per-world generator. This means it will create a new set of settings for each world it generates. This allows you to configure the plugin for each world individually.

All of the following settings can be found in this folder:

* World settings
* Default biome settings
* Custom biome settings \(if you added any\)
* Chest settings

```bash
*/<world folder>/settings/
```

Each of the individual settings can then be found under:

```bash
 world-settings.json # World settings.
 biomes
    default # Default biome settings folder.
    custom # Custom biome settings folder.
 chest-configuration # Chest settings.
```
