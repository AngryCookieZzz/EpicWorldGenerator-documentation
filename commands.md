# Commands

In order to use EWG to its full potential, there are a few handy commands for you to use.

`/ewg createworld`

{% hint style="info" %}
> This command opens a GUI from which you can pick a preset for a new world.
{% endhint %}



`/ewg info`

{% hint style="info" %}
> This command shows you what biome you are currently in, so you can find it in the configuration files easier.
{% endhint %}



`/ewg tp`

{% hint style="info" %}
> This command lets you teleport to a biome of your choice. The biome name is the same as the one you get from `/ewg info`, and the same as the name of the file in the configurations.
{% endhint %}



`/ewg create`

{% hint style="info" %}
> This command allows to turn your WorldEdit selection into a EWG schematic \(not the same as normal WorldEdit schematics\). You first select the structure with WorldEdit, then use the command, specifying the center X, Y and Z positions, as well as a name. The X, Y and Z positions will correspond to the location at which the plugin will paste the schematic in the world.
{% endhint %}



`/ewg paste`

{% hint style="info" %}
> This command pastes any EWG structure you provide. You can find the name of the structure in the structures folder. `*/plugins/EpicWorldGenerator/EWGFiles/`.
{% endhint %}



`/ewg bugreport`

{% hint style="info" %}
> This command is outdated and should no longer be used, instead, use the [this](https://github.com/jonryf/EpicWorldGenerator-bugtracker/issues).
{% endhint %}



`/ewg install`

{% hint style="info" %}
TO DO
{% endhint %}
