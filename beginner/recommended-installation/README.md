# Recommended installation

## \(Work in progress\)

This is our recommendation as to how to install the plugin to make it perform as best as possible. You can also follow a more [basic instruction](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/basic-installation). If you have any issues with any of the steps in this process, make sure to contact our support team at [Discord](https://discord.gg/Jq3ecb3).

### Preparations

0. Before all, stop the server.

{% hint style="danger" %}
> This plugin does **not** work with FAWE \(Fast Async World Edit\)
{% endhint %}

#### Gathering files

{% hint style="warning" %}
> The installation of the plugin requires both EpicWorldGenerator and WorldEdit.
{% endhint %}

1. Download and put the [EWG](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicworldgenerator-1-14-1-15-2-support-all-update-aquatic-features.8067/) and [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) plugins in the `*/plugin` folder.

2. Download any additional add-ons

{% hint style="info" %}
> A recommended, yet optional, add-on is the [Maiskorf's Additional Biome Pack \(Guide\)](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/recommended-installation/maiskorfs-additional-biome-pack). If you want to add these later on, make sure to download them beforehand.

{% hint style="success" %}
> Other options would be the [Maiskorf's Mars and / or Moon Landscapes](https://discordapp.com/channels/576841187256827905/576844840847802398/714083091504693278) or the [Mushroom-Tree Biome by Zikiv](https://discordapp.com/channels/576841187256827905/576844840847802398/710821492321157170). Installing these is similarly done as to [Maiskorf's Additional Biome Pack \(Guide\)](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/recommended-installation/maiskorfs-additional-biome-pack)
