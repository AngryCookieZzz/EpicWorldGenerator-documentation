# EpicWorldGenerator-documentation
EpicWorldGenerator documentation. See https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/

This is a partially official branch off of the main Wiki.
The main wiki was made under version 7 of the plugin, which is very outdated, as we are currently far into version 8.
For now, until the main developer and upkeeper of the github merges this branch,
I will use this as a place to refer people to, while maintaining active development.

I will add all contributors here.
